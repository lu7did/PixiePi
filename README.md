# PixiePi


## Ham radio Pixie Transceiver controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero W board

The Pixie QRPp (very low power, less than 1W output) transceiver is a very popular DIY project among hams as it is
very easy to build, test and operate from the electronic standpoint, yet able to perform some actual limited communications
(QSO) over the air.

Although really small power can be enough to sustain communications over great distances and therefore not being a per se
limiting factor there are other factors in the basic implementation which makes difficult to carry communications except
on very favorable conditions.

An explanation of how the transceiver work can be found [here](http://w1sye.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NCRC_PixieOperation.pdf).

This project starts with a working Pixie transceiver (a cheap kit bought at eBay or other sellers) and to integrate it with
a Raspberry Pi to provide the signal generation and other functionality.

Instead of a crystal based signal generation the Raspberry Pi itself can be used by meas of the librpitx library (by Evariste Courjaud F5OEO
acting as a DDS, which is thus the technical core of the project. A carrier generation function has been modelled largely using the tune.cpp program
available at the package also by Evariste Courjaud F5OEO. Some modifications has been introduced to allow the carrier frequency to be varied during the 
operation.

The rest of the code deals mostly with the user interface and operating features, among others:

* Receive over an entire ham radio band.

* Dual VFO setup, split mode, controllable step.

* RIT operation.

* Frequency can be shift during transmission to implement CW.

* Sidetone generation.

* Transmission controlled by processor.

* Display LCD & Rotary Encoder.

* Built-in iambic keyer, with variable speed.

* Variable DDS drive level.

* Capable of operating most digital modes with very small modifications.

* Full or Partial Break-In in transmit.

* Perhaps, some day, even to manage SSB using a firmware approach (PE1NNZ)

# Fair and educated warning

Raspberry Pi is a marvel.

Hamradio is the best thing ever invented.

Â¡So don't ruin either by connecting GPIO04 directly to an antenna!

You'll make life of others in your neighboor unsormountable, and even
could get your Raspberry Pi fried in the process.

Google "raspberry pi rpitx low pass filter" to get some good advice on what to put between your Raspberry and your antenna
Or go to https://www.dk0tu.de/blog/2016/05/28_Raspberry_Pi_Lowpass_Filters/ for very good and easy to implement ideas

Remember that most national regulations requires the armonics and other spurious outcome to be -30 dB below the fundamental.

## Headless operation (all controls thru CAT)

**Warning**
Basic Pixie Chinese DIY kits are not prepared for continuous operation thermal sink is needed in both PA final and keyer
Pin VOL+ of the Pixie board connects to pin 7 of the IC LM386 which is usually left open without connection as a way to feed
the sidetone.


# Chinese Pixie MODS

Some minor modifications are needed while building the Chinese DIY Pixie kit, other versionas might vary:

## Components not needed

The following components needs not to be placed when building the kit

* D2 - Diode 1N4001
* R6 - R 100K
* C8 - C 100nF
* W1 - R 47K (var)
* D3 - Diode 1N4148
* Y1 - Cristal 7.032 MHz

## Different connections

* Connect Pin 7 LM386 to PWM exit from interface card (sidetone)
* Connect Cx=100 nF on the same place than Y1 on the kit.
* Connect positive side of D2 diode to the interface board PTT line

## Broadcast Interference (BCI)

At some locations the Chinese DIY Pixie kit might be subject to heavy BCI, in order to minimize try to replace R3 from
1K to 47-100 Ohms.

# Other alternatives

Even if the Pixie schematic is used for the project the software could be used directly with other DIY or homebrew popular
designs, among others:

# Case 3D Design

The preliminar 3D design for a project case (with LCD) can be seen as follows

[PixiePi 3D Case Design](docs/PixiePi_with_LCD.stl)

**Warning**
Current 3D STL file has material width, height, size and STL integrity issues and requires rework (see pending at issues)


# Package requirements

*   sudo apt-get install i2c-tools libi2c-dev
*   sudo apt-get install socat
*   git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
*   git clone https://github.com/F5OEO/librpitx && cd librpitx/src && make 
*   Enable I2C and SPI with sudo raspi-config
*   Follow instructions to download and buid the FLRIG package from [here](http://www.w1hkj.com/flrig-help/)

# Build

*  git clone https://github.com/lu7did/PixiePi
*  cd /home/pi/PixiePi/src

# Release notes:

  * This project requires a board combining:

     - Raspberry Pi
     - Pixie Transceiver
     - Glueware simple electronics to switch transmitter, connect keyer and others.

  This setup can be used with flrig as the front-end and CAT controller (**headless mode**), it should work with any
  other software supporting a Yaesu FT-817 model CAT command set.

# Operating WSPR

WSPR can be operated either as a monitoring station or as a beacon (or both).

## Monitoring station

* Plug the PHONE exit to the LINE-IN entry of a soundcard.
* Start the pixie program with ./bash/pixie.sh (correct frequency to 7038600).
* Use WSJTX to monitor, select Mode as WSPR
* Ctl-C to terminate.

## Beacon station

* Run ./bash/PiWSPR.sh (replace your call, grid and power).
* this program will run once, so call it repeatedely with a timing of your choice, WSPR frames fires on even minutes.

# Operating FT8

FT8 can be operated either as a monitoring station or as a beacon (or both).

## Monitoring station
Same as WSPR monitoring station but selecting 7074000 as the frequency and FT8 at WSJTX

## Beacon station
* Run pift8 from the rpitx package.


# Other programs

  * DDSPi
    - DDS function controllable thru CAT

  * OT817
    - Transceiver USB controllable thru CAT

  * PiWSPR
    - WSPR beacon using a QRPp transceiver

  * pirtty
    - RTTY beacon

  * iambic-keyer
    An iambic-keyer for code practice

  * Optional 
     - Rotary encoder
     - LCD 16x2 display
     - USB soundcard (optional)

#  Work in progress, this code set is not yet functional, hardware has many issues, build experience needed at this point.

# Other packages

In general the hardware can be used to implement modulation modes proposed by the [rpitx package](https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx).
In some cases the RF chain after the Raspberry Pi needs to be activated, the hardware on this project uses the
GPIO19 line as the PTT, some programs might require this line to be activated or deactivated externally.
