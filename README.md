## Ham radio Pixie Transceiver controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero W board

The Pixie QRPp (very low power, less than 1W output) transceiver is a very popular DIY project among hams as it is
very easy to build, test and operate from the electronic standpoint, yet able to perform some actual limited communications
(QSO) over the air.

Although really small power can be enough to sustain communications over great distances and therefore not being a per se
limiting factor there are other factors in the basic implementation which makes difficult to carry communications except
on very favorable conditions.

An explanation of how the transceiver work can be found [here](http://w1sye.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NCRC_PixieOperation.pdf).

This project starts with a working Pixie transceiver (a cheap kit bought at eBay or other sellers) and to integrate it with
a Raspberry Pi to provide the signal generation and other functionality.

Instead of a crystal based signal generation the Raspberry Pi itself can be used by meas of the librpitx library (by Evariste Courjaud F5OEO
acting as a DDS, which is thus the technical core of the project. A carrier generation function has been extracted largely form the tune.cpp program
available at the package also by Evariste Courjaud F5OEO. Some modifications has been introduced to allow the carrier frequency to be varied during the 
operation.

The rest of the code deals mostly with the user interface and operating features, among others:

* Receive over an entire ham radio band.

* Dual VFO setup, split mode.

* Frequency can be shift during transmission.

* Sidetone generation.

* Transmission controlled by processor.

* Display LCD & Rotary Encoder.

* Built-in iambic keyer.

* Capable of operating most digital modes

* Perhaps, some day, even to manage SSB using a firmware approach (PE1NNZ)

# Fair and educated warning

Raspberry Pi is a marvel.

Hamradio is the best thing ever invented.

Â¡So don't ruin either by connecting GPIO04 directly to an antenna!

You'll make life of others in your neighboor unsormountable, and even
could get your Raspberry Pi fried in the process.

Google "raspberry pi rpitx low pass filter" to get some good advice on what to put between your Raspberry and your antenna
Or go to https://www.dk0tu.de/blog/2016/05/28_Raspberry_Pi_Lowpass_Filters/ for very good and easy to implement ideas

Remember that most national regulations requires the armonics and other spurious outcome to be -30 dB below the fundamental.
