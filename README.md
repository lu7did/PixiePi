# PixiePi


## Ham radio Pixie Transceiver controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero W board

The Pixie QRPp (very low power, less than 1W output) transceiver is a very popular DIY project among hams as it is
very easy to build, test and operate from the electronic standpoint, yet able to perform some actual limited communications
(QSO) over the air.

Although really small power can be enough to sustain communications over great distances and therefore not being a per se
limiting factor there are other factors in the basic implementation which makes difficult to carry communications except
on very favorable conditions.

An explanation of how the transceiver work can be found [here](http://w1sye.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NCRC_PixieOperation.pdf).

This project starts with a working Pixie transceiver (a cheap kit bought at eBay or other sellers) and to integrate it with
a Raspberry Pi to provide the signal generation and other functionality.

Instead of a crystal based signal generation the Raspberry Pi itself can be used by meas of the librpitx library (by Evariste Courjaud F5OEO
acting as a DDS, which is thus the technical core of the project. A carrier generation function has been modelled largely using the tune.cpp program
available at the package also by Evariste Courjaud F5OEO. Some modifications has been introduced to allow the carrier frequency to be varied during the 
operation.

The rest of the code deals mostly with the user interface and operating features, among others:

* Receive over an entire ham radio band.

* Dual VFO setup, split mode, controllable step.

* RIT operation.

* Frequency can be shift during transmission to implement CW.

* Sidetone generation.

* Transmission controlled by processor.

* Display LCD & Rotary Encoder.

* Built-in iambic keyer, with variable speed.

* Variable DDS drive level.

* Capable of operating most digital modes with very small modifications.

* Full or Partial Break-In in transmit.

* Perhaps, some day, even to manage SSB using a firmware approach (PE1NNZ)

# Fair and educated warning

Raspberry Pi is a marvel.

Hamradio is the best thing ever invented.

Â¡So don't ruin either by connecting GPIO04 directly to an antenna!

You'll make life of others in your neighboor unsormountable, and even
could get your Raspberry Pi fried in the process.

Google "raspberry pi rpitx low pass filter" to get some good advice on what to put between your Raspberry and your antenna
Or go to https://www.dk0tu.de/blog/2016/05/28_Raspberry_Pi_Lowpass_Filters/ for very good and easy to implement ideas

Remember that most national regulations requires the armonics and other spurious outcome to be -30 dB below the fundamental.

# Schematics

## With 16x2 LCD and Rotary Encoder

## Headless operation (all controls thru CAT) 

![Alt Text](docs/PixiePiHL.jpg?raw=true "PixiePi Schematics operating headless without 16x2 LCD Display and Rotary Encoder")

**Warning**
Basic Pixie Chinese DIY kits are not prepared for continuous operation thermal sink is needed in both PA final and keyer
Pin VOL+ of the Pixie board connects to pin 7 of the IC LM386 which is usually left open without connection as a way to feed
the sidetone.

## Hardware prototype

This is a snapshot of the very early prototype used to develop and debug this project:

# Chinese Pixie MODS

Some minor modifications are needed while building the Chinese DIY Pixie kit, other versions might vary:

## Components not needed

The following components needs not to be placed when building the kit

* D2 - Diode 1N4001
* R6 - R 100K
* C8 - C 100nF
* W1 - R 47K (var)
* D3 - Diode 1N4148
* Y1 - Cristal 7.032 MHz

## Different connections

* Connect Pin 7 LM386 to PWM exit from interface card (sidetone) marked as Vol+ in the schematic.
* Connect Cx=100 nF on the same place than Y1 on the kit.
* Connect positive side of D2 diode to the interface board PTT line

## Broadcast Interference (BCI)

At some locations the Chinese DIY Pixie kit might be subject to heavy BCI, in order to minimize try to replace R3 from
1K to 47-100 Ohms.

# Other alternatives

Even if the Pixie schematic is used for the project the software could be used directly with other DIY or homebrew popular
designs, among others:

# Release notes:

  * This project requires a board combining:

     - Raspberry Pi
     - Pixie Transceiver
     - Glueware simple electronics to switch transmitter, connect keyer and others.

  This setup can be used with flrig as the front-end and CAT controller (**headless mode**), it should work with any
  other software supporting a Yaesu FT-817 model CAT command set.

# Operating WSPR

WSPR can be operated either as a monitoring station or as a beacon.

## Monitoring station

* Plug the PHONE exit to the LINE-IN entry of a soundcard.
* Start the pixie program with ./bash/pixie.sh (correct frequency to 7038600).
* Use WSJTX to monitor, select Mode as WSPR
* Ctl-C to terminate.

Your mileage might vary depending on local CONDX, antenna available and overall noise floor at your location,
some fairly strong signals can be decoded this way, after all it's just a very simple (tiniest imaginable)
double conversion receiver at work. Follows an example of a report captured from a WSPR Beacon in PY-Land some
500+ miles North of me.

![Alt Text](docs/PixiePi_WSPR.jpg?raw=true "WSJT-X Program using PixiePi as the receiver for WSPR monitoring")


## Beacon station

* Run ./bash/PiWSPR.sh (replace your call, grid and power). A sample script can be found at bash/PiWSPR.sh
This program will run once, so call it repeatedely with a timing of your choice, WSPR frames align and fire on even minutes.

Follows a screen capture of some reports given by the WSPRNet monitoring network[link](http://www.wsprnet.org), a fair distance has been achieved considered
the power output were in the order of 200 mW during the tests!

# Operating FT8

FT8 can be operated either as a monitoring station or as a beacon.

## Monitoring station
Same as WSPR monitoring station but selecting 7074000 as the frequency and FT8 at WSJTX, your mileage might vary
depending on local CONDX, antenna settings and overall noise floor at your locations, it's just a very basic
transceiver so probably relatively strong signals will be detected.

Sample of FT8 receiving:

![Alt Text](docs/PixiePi_FT8.jpg?raw=true "WSJT-X Program using PixiePi as the receiver for FT8 monitoring")

## Beacon station
Run pift8 from the rpitx package, simultaneous monitoring and beaconing will require a larger Raspberry Pi in order
to accomodate the extra power to run WSJT-X. Sample script can be found at bash/PiFT8.sh

Follows a screen capture of some reports given by the PSKReporter monitoring network[link](http://pskreporter.info), a fair distance has been achieved considered
the power output were in the order of 200 mW during the tests!

![Alt Text](docs/PixiePi_Reports_FT8.png?raw=true "Reports from PSKReporter network during the test")


# Operating as a CW transceiver

Configure settings accordingly at the pixie.cfg file and fire bash/pixie.sh

The following settings can be configured using the CAT interface, most changes will be made permanent at the pixie.cfg
file upon termination.

## Keyer

Using the default configuration (KEYER_MODE=0) the keyer will work as a straight keyer, however the keying must be made
thru the interface in order for the program to detect changes and shift frequencies in CW accordingly. Other keyer modes
can be programed using (KEYER_MODE=1 and KEYER_MODE=2).
When programmed as modes other than CW or CWR the keyer will basically become a PTT line (low=ON,high=OFF).


# Other programs

  * DDSPi
    - DDS function controllable thru CAT

  * OT817
    - Transceiver USB controllable thru CAT

  * pirtty
    - RTTY beacon

  * Optional hardware 
     - Rotary encoder
     - LCD 16x2 display
     - USB soundcard (optional)

**Work in progress, this code set is not yet functional, hardware has many issues, build experience needed at this point.

# CAT Control

CAT control can be performed over the programs of this project as they implement a limited subset of the Yaesu FT-817 CAT Command set.
Commands are carried thru an internal pipe (created using the socat package, see bash/pixie.sh script for details) which looks to the
controlling program just like a serial port (usually /tmp/tty0).

Operated in "headless" mode, with no tunning control or LCD display, this feature can be used to operate the transceiver.

Two alternatives has been tested:

## FLRig
FLRig can be built on the Raspberry Pi and used to control the PixiePi rig just configuring it as a FT-817 with the serial port as
/tmp/ttyv0. The PixiePi program must be up a running and the pipe established when this program is run.
Being a graphic X-Window app FLRig is somewhat taxing on resources and might not perform well when using a Raspberry Pi Zero W, however
it will run just fine on a Raspberry Pi 3 or higher.

##RigCtl
RigCtl is a companion program of the HamLib library, it's main advantage is  a console operation with a very low resources consumption,
therefore it can be used on a Raspberry Pi Zero W to control the rig. See bash/pixie.sh in order to understand the way to configure it.

The rigctl interface is a server running in the background (rigctld) which can be accessed using a telnet interface at localhost port 4532.

See the docs/rigctl_commands.txt for a summary of the commands or visit the Hamlib page for complete documentation.

# Other packages

In general the hardware can be used to implement modulation modes proposed by the [rpitx package](https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx).
In some cases the RF chain after the Raspberry Pi needs to be activated, the hardware on this project uses the
GPIO12 line as the PTT, some programs might require this line to be activated or deactivated externally.

#  Work in progress, this code set is not yet functional
