# rotary-encoder-library-for-raspberry-pi
A library for easy use of rotary encoders gang without or with push switch in their axis, 4 rotations speeds level and pushed button duration detection. Need "wiringPi" library to work.
Based on IRQ detection for a Raspberry Pi, includes a temptative to control undesired bounces and have some kind of universal object description to be used in any bigger project.
Could be easily adapted for any C or C++ other computing platform.
